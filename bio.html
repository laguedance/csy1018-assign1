    <h1>About Yves</h1>
    <p>Before I was 17, I did not have a lot of interest in school. I wasn't sure about what I wanted to do and what career I will be doing in the future. Despite that, I had a passion for computers. I always had an interest for things that are related to technology. But I did not know that that passion could help me in my studies. So in 2012 when I started college, I was directed to IT. When the course was explained to me, I immediately took interest.  I come from a very hard working background: my mother instilled in me very good values, commitment, knowledge and determination are some of the things that have made me very driven. My passion developed into a skill and from this I found the career I want to do in the future. Studying IT has helped expand my skills and knowledge in this section of work. The basic terms of the computer language, like database or spreadsheets etc...I feel this is the perfect field for me to pursue a career in simply because I possess all the right characteristics that a person in this position would need in order to excel further in this path. I have strong communication skills, including strong listening skills which are crucial for this role. I am very sympathetic and I enjoy solving problems and being able to help friends or family. I may not have known these terms before but as I learned, my hunger to learn has grew more and more over the years. What I enjoy studying the most is computer system. The idea of localizing a problem and solving it makes me very happy and I also feel useful and encourage when Iâ€™m doing something I enjoy.
I am currently studying a Level 3 Access to IT  at Barking & Dagenham College where I have 6 units to do with programming, I enjoy all the units I have done, these are some of the units I enjoy doing System analysis, Web design and Computer system. I grew up with a very high interest in sport due to my competitive nature. I love sport, especially basketball. I started playing basketball at the age of 11. IT has helped develop my ability to work in a team and I know that this transferable skill will be beneficial in my studies as well in my career as a software developer. I like the game aspect, the competition and I am good at it. This is also something I am passionate about while I do not play anymore; watching Football on television is one of my favourite hobbies. During the London 2012 Olympics I was a cashier for, a catering company: in this post I dealt with money transactions and I had very good interaction with the clients. When I was studying for my level 2 in IT in that same year, I did a work placement for three weeks in a care home. Part of my role was to socialise with the clients (reassure them by talking to them about any topic they were interested in) and to help them with their daily personal care. I enjoyed the caring responsibilities.
With the new generation, the use of computers is on the rise, with that, many are not able to sort out problems and go through a lot of troubles with the computers or machines. Software, applications sometimes have malfunctions and I am sure that by continuing in my subject, I will help a lot of people.
When I am not at college, I enjoy playing football. As well as working my brain out, I also like working out physically. In football, it is required to find the weakness of the opponent in order to win. It's a bit like finding the fault in a computer and solving it to have the victory over the malfunction. I am a native French speaker and I also speak English as a second language. I would like to learn Mandarin and Arabic as I would like to go to Canada or Australia after I graduate from university to pursue my career.
I would like to achieve my goals and interest by going to university and after completing my degree to gradate and, go into my career in IT (Software engineering).
